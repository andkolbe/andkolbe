Hello!, I'm Andrew, a pastry chef turned software engineer from Texas who currently lives in Birmingham.

I have a few years of experience as a back end web developer writing apps in Go and Typescript and configuring them with AWS.

I’m currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech OMSCS program studying Computing and Database Systems. My goal is to work in database internals.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and learning about new cuisines and cultures, listening to obscure metal and 70s prog rock, and spending time watching sports with my lazy dog.
