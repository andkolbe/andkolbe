Hello!, I'm Andrew, a pastry chef turned web developer from Texas who recently moved to Birmingham.

I have years of experience working in high stress, team focused, and technically challenging environments. I love growing with and learning from a team, and helping other motivated people reach their potential.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and learning about new cuisines and cultures, listening to obscure metal, and spending time with my lazy dog

I’m currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech OMSCS program
