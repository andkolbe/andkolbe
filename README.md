Hello!, I'm Andrew, a pastry chef turned software engineer from Texas who currently lives in Birmingham.

I have years of experience working in high stress, team focused, and technically challenging environments. I love growing with and learning from a team, and helping other motivated people reach their potential.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking and learning about new cuisines and cultures, listening to obscure metal, and spending time with my lazy dog.

I’m currently enrolled in the Georgia Tech OMSCS program studying Computing and Database Systems
